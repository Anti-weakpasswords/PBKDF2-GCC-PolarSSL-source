PBKDF2-GCC-PolarSSL-source
==========================

GCC and PolarSSL library based PBKDF2 implementation. Works in Linux and Windows with MinGW.


Ideally, you should download your own copy of PolarSSL source code and compile it yourself (at this time, 1.3.4 is what it was compiled with) and extract it so that you have (assume backslashes on Windows, obviously):
pbkdf2_polarssl.c
config.h
etc.
etc.
polarssl-1.3.4/include/*
polarssl-1.3.4/library/*

The Releases section will have the source code used to compile each particular executable, as well as the executable itself.
