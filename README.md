PBKDF2-GCC-PolarSSL-source
==========================

GCC and PolarSSL library based PBKDF2 implementation. Works in Linux and Windows with MinGW.


Ideally, you should download your own copy of PolarSSL source code (at this time, 1.3.4 is what it was compiled with) and extract it so that you have (assume backslashes on Windows, obviously):
pbkdf2_polarssl.c
config.h
etc.
etc.
polarssl-1.3.4/include/*
polarssl-1.3.4/library/*

Then you can compile it.
